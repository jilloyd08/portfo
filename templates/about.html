                  <h3>GOD Fearing</h3>
                  <p style="color: navajowhite;">For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of GOD for Salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile
                  Romans 1:16
                  "Christian" tends to get hated on a lot in this era. A lot of people have been persecuted and betrayed by who the see claim to be Christians. But the word Christian does Not mean perfect. There is only 1 who walked this earth Perfectly and His Name is Jesus. He became the spotless lamb, perfect and Holy, and purposely took our place on the Cross! As Christ followers, we are to look to Him and do our best to live out His Values everyday! I Know I mess up and I Know I'm Not perfect, but I hope that I can make a positive difference in peoples lives. We get so distracted by the world and all the negativity that we forget to just say "hello" and just be a decent human being. Today, try to hold a door for someone, give a compliment, give encouragement and just... SMILE! üòÅ I think you'll be surprise how GOD can use you and your smile to help someone who needs it!</p>
                  <h3>Husband & Father</h3>
                  <p style="color: navajowhite;">I met my Queen my senior year of high school and with all the doubters, we're still Together! We got married a couple years later and it was one of the Best decisions I ever made. She is Smart, Strong, Funni, SEXI and Incredible in so many ways!! She has stuck by me through some of my lowest moments in life and puts up with all my crazy! ü§£ GOD Blessed us with 4 Amazing children all 3 years apart lol. We have 2 boys and 2 girls ranging from 19 to 10 and they are a beautiful motivation. It's one of the main reasons I have decided on this career path because I want to provide for them even more and give my Queen a homestead! LOL. Each decision I make is to lead us in the right direction and I lean on GOD for that discernment every day! I LOVE YOU Queen!!!! And I'm ready for our Eternity Together!! üëëüòçüíúüß°ü•∞üëë
                  <h3>Music & Swag</h3>
                  <p style="color: navajowhite;">
                  Music moves me! From a young age I was drawn to hip hop and rap, but I can listen to most any music. Some I do because I enjoy the artist and the lyrics. Others I just enjoy the art. Growing up in Church, I love hearing some of the old soul music that can come with it and I played the drums for many years. I remember being up late nights in my room freestylin' to instrumentals or just rappin' my favorite songs. Younger me liked some OG's like DMX, Methodman & Redman, Nelly and Lil Wayne. As I started making changes, I found Christian Hip Hop and Rap had just as much swag! Lecrae is someone most everyone has probably heard of, as he started Reach Records. Then you got my man Andy Mineo, KB, some old school like Unity Clan lol, and some new school like Zauntee. In recent years my guy NF is my most listened to artist and he has been a huge inspiration to many. His songs and lyrics express what most people feel, but never say and that allows people to connect to him. Check out his most recent album "HOPE" <a>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDNtAuXIhbEOsxdU4Q4HRW1PFTU-sGfXI</a>

                  Also from a young age, I've always been into my swag lol, my style. Sneakerhead through and through! I'm talking way back to some Adidas Turleshell Superstars, then you got the Nike Air Max's and, shoooot, ya boy even rocked some Filas! More recently I'm really digging the Nike SB Dunk scene and AJ 1 Lows.
                  Then I'm all about my Snap Backs! If you're looking for some fire that has a message check out Art of Homage (AOH) <a>https://artofhomage.com/</a> </p>
