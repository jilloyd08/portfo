This is a server I have created using Python where I can display my journey through school under Zero to Mastery.
I'll have my project uploaded, eventually, and will use this for job applications, resumes, and interviews.
It will be fully functional and interactive, and will be raw! School has us performing a lot of different tasks and
I'm also a full-time General Manager for a wheelchair accessible auto dealer and mobility equipment service provider.
I hope my different projects come through clearly and I hope this helps prove my willingness to continue to learn!
